primarily in Africa and a small part of India.
Males are distinguished by a prominent mane,

relying on stealth and speed to catch prey like zebras and antelopes. Lions are recognized for their majestic appearance, strong build, and a powerful roar that can be heard from miles away, a sound used for communication and territorial defense.
